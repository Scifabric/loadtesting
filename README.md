Load testing of PyBossa instances
=================================

Load tests for a production PyBossa instance.

After reviewing several load testing solutions (e.g. JMeter, funkload) we decided to use [Locust](http://locust.io/).

**Warning:** Please do load tests only with your **own** PyBossa server!
The files in this repo are examples on how to write a load tester for PyBossa.

## Installation

### Install on a Vagrant VM (recommend)

Installation on a Vagrant VM is recommend because it is optimized for high load testing and it seems to produce more reliable results during our tests.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/PyBossa/loadtesting.git
cd loadtesting
```

Setup the VM
```
vagrant up
```

#### Do load testing with Vagrant

connect to VM
```
vagrant ssh
```
and go the mapped local folder with
```
cd /vagrant
```

To run a locust load test file run them e.g. with
```
locust -f pybossa-locust/mainandprojects.py --host http://yourpybossaserver
```

and open the locust UI in your browser (port 9089):   
[http://localhost:9089](http://localhost:9089)

To start a very simple load test set  
**users** to `100`  
and  
**hatch** rate to `10`

Start running the load test and see the result in your browser! :)

### Install locally

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/PyBossa/loadtesting.git
cd loadtesting
```

> It is recommend (but of course optional) to use virtualenv: [Manual for virtualenv usage](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/virtualenv.html#usage).

#### Install Locust
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Do load testing

All available load tests are in the `pybossa-locust` folder.  
If you want to write them yourself look at the [Locust manual](http://docs.locust.io/en/latest/index.html).

To run a locust file run them e.g. with
```
locust -f pybossa-locust/mainandprojects.py --host http://yourpybossaserver
```

and open the locust UI in your browser:    
[http://localhost:8089](http://localhost:9089) --> Because it has been forwarded from vagrantFile
